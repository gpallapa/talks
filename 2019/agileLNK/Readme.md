This talk was given at Geist in Lincoln, Nebraska.

In this session, we look at the common rituals that Agile teams participate in, and learn how to increase productivity, throughput, and accountability in these rituals. We will also run a couple of exercises on quick backlog prioritization techniques, formulating experiments, and release planning.

You will learn:
* How to gamify your meetings and get more throughput out of them
* Quick prioritization techniques for refining the backlog with product owners and stakeholders
* Running continuous experiments, optimizing demos and retros
